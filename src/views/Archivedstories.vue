    <h1>Archived Stories</h1>
    <p>Preserve and share your stories for generations.</p>
    <button>Your Private Archived Stories</button>  <button>Public Archived Stories</button>
    <p>Our <b>Guiding Principle</b> is that these interviews and other family records <b>reflect the perspectives</b> of the interviewees and their family. While the interview files are archived by the Evergreen Family Stories System, the family—particularly the interviewee—<b>retains contro</b>l over who, aside from the system admin, can access the files and under what circumstances.</p>
