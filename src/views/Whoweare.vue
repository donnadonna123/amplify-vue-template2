 <p>Our <b>Guiding Principle</b> is that these interviews and other family records <b>reflect the perspectives</b> of the interviewees and their family. While the interview files are archived by the Evergreen Family Stories System, the family—particularly the interviewee—<b>retains control</b> over who, aside from the system admin, can access the files and under what circumstances.</p>
